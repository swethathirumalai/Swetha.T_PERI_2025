""Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with n rows and  m columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of  bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied. For example:

Given  n and m, what's the minimum number of packages that Luke must drop to supply all of his bases?

Example

n=2
m=3
Packages can be dropped at the corner between cells (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1) to supply 4 bases. Another package can be dropped at a border between (0, 2) and (1, 2). This supplies all bases using  packages.

Function Description

Complete the gameWithCells function in the editor below.

gameWithCells has the following parameters:

int n: the number of rows in the game
int m: the number of columns in the game
Returns

int: the minimum number of packages required
Input Format

Two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and m .

Constraints
0<n, m<=1000

Sample Input 0

2 2
Sample Output 0

Luke has four bases in a 2*2  grid. If he drops a single package where the walls of all four bases intersect, then those four cells can access the package:

Because he managed to supply all four bases with a single supply drop, we print  as our answer."""

code:
def handshakes(n):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
